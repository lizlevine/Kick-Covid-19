This full-stack web application provides an open-source platform for those effected by the Covid-19 pandemic to share their experience and contribute to others in a Reddit like format.Anyone can read the posts, but in order to post or reply to posts, the user must register and login.

The Kick-Covid also includes a CDC Twitter feed on the homepage as well as a page dedicated to FAQ with links and resouces including organizations that need volunteers, resources for handling emotional issues and anxiety.

In a later iteration, our intention is to features blogs and stories from medical professionals, first responders and other front line workers.

##### User arrives at the homepage, clicks on Blog which takes them to a list of posts where they can either create their own post or reply to someone elses.
